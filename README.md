Getting Started
-------------------------

Install the prerequsites:

- [ ] Virtualbox
- [ ] Vagrant
- [ ] Chef-dk

Then run:

`vagrant up`

and wait. The download will take quite some time as the box is rather large. The downloads are not resumable as far as I know, so ensure that you have some time before you start. 

At the end of the provisioning, you will have a server 2k8 box with chef-client installed and the box will be configured for remote administration.
